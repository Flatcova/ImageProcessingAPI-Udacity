## Project Overview

Welcome to my Image Processing API project, In this project, you will see how I build an API, with Node.js and Express for handling the app 
process, and creating all the testing with Jasmine. Everything was developed with TypeScript and compiled to JS on the dist folder. The main purpose of this project is to take some parameters throw the URL, and depending on the values that where sended, create a new resized image, and saved it localy.

![Sample Input Image][image1]

this is an image example that was received throw the URL queries and wanted to be changed, and the result was the next image, saved in the new-image folder and now every time the user wants the same image, it will be cache from that folder.

![Output Image resized to 100x100][image2]
